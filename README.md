# Sales Performance Report For TATA Company (Interactive Dashboards Creation using PowerBI)

## Project Objective:

### Business Requests for CEO:
- The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only.
  
- He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month.
  
- The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur.
  
- This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

- The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products.
  
- He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products.
  
- Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions.
  
- He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand.
  
- There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### Business Requests for CMO:
- The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue.
  
- Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated.
   
- The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

- The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue.
  
- He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers.
  
- The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

  ## Final Conclusion:
 The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the business's strong performance, highlighting its ability to meet sales and budget targets. However,
 there are opportunities for improvement in product category diversification, geographic reach, and customer growth.

-  Key Strengths:

    Achieving 22M in sales, surpassing the 21M budget.
    A solid customer base of 18K customers with strong contributions from top-performing customers.
    Geographic sales clusters in high-demand regions like North America, Europe, and Asia.
    Exceptional performance in the Clothing category, contributing over 95% of total sales.

-  Key Challenges:

    Over-reliance on a single product category (Clothing) poses a risk.
    Limited sales contributions from underperforming regions (South America and Africa) and categories (Bikes and Accessories).
    Room to grow the customer base beyond the existing 18K.

-  Future Outlook:
  
    By focusing on diversification, customer acquisition, and regional expansion, the business can sustain growth and build resilience. Leveraging seasonal peaks and customer loyalty        programs can further enhance profitability.

  ## Sales Improvement Recommendations:
 1- Focus on Product Mix:

   Introduce promotions or bundle offers for underperforming categories like Bikes and Accessories to increase their contribution.

 2- Customer Retention Programs: 

   Offer loyalty rewards or personalized offers to top customers like Jordan Turner to ensure continued engagement.

 3- Geographic Targeting:

   Invest in marketing campaigns in less saturated regions to expand the customer base globally.

 4- Seasonal Promotions:

   Leverage peak months like May, August, and October to maximize sales through discounts or limited-time offers.
